If you have an interest in creating computer programs, mobile apps, websites, games or any other piece of software, you'll need to learn how to program. Programs are created through the use of a programming language. This language allows the program to function with the machine it is running on, be it a computer, a mobile phone, or any other piece of hardware.

1. Determine your area of interest.
2. Consider starting with a "simpler" language.
3. Read through some basic tutorials for a variety of languages.
4. Practice.
5. Code. Just do it.
